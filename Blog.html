<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Kamala Harris and other Celebrities on How They Age Gracefully</span><br><br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><img width="773" title="" assetid="kamila" src="https://skinbyhaxton.com/image/kamila.jpg" height="438" border="0" alt="" selectedfileurl="files/kamila.jpg" mce_src="https://skinbyhaxton.com/image/kamila.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">PALO ALTO, Calif.&nbsp;-&nbsp;Sept. 23, 2024&nbsp;-&nbsp;PRLog&nbsp;--&nbsp;(http://www.skinbyhaxton.com)&nbsp;As the 2024 presidential race intensifies, one name is making waves not just in politics but also in conversations about beauty and grace: Kamala Harris. With her Indian and Jamaican heritage, Harris stands as a powerful symbol of America's diversity. As she vies for the presidency, her radiant, youthful appearance speaks volumes about her commitment to self-care and wellness&mdash;attributes that resonate with many across the nation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Alongside Harris, other icons like Zendaya, Awkwafina, Mindy Kaling, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Yara Shahidi, and Henry Golding represent a current era of beauty&mdash;one that embraces ethnic diversity and the art of aging gracefully. These figures are celebrated not only for their professional achievements but also for their ability to maintain a youthful glow while navigating the complexities of ethnic skincare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">As America's demographic landscape continues to evolve, with nearly 45% of the population now identifying as non-white, the demand for specialized skincare treatments for ethnic skin types has never been greater. This is where Richard Haxton of Richard Haxton's Transformational Skin Solutions in Los Altos excels. Renowned for his expertise in addressing the unique needs of ethnic skin, Haxton has been voted #1 in his alternatives to plastic surgery and awarded "Best Beauty Treatment, 2024"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">"Ethnic skin types, particularly those of Asian, Latinx, Black, and Middle Eastern descent, require specialized care," says Haxton. "Traditional procedures like laser resurfacing and certain injectables can actually do more harm than good, often leading to issues like hyperpigmentation, scarring, and keloids."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Haxton's Approach to Skincare</span><br><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Haxton's journey into skincare began with his own challenges with hyperpigmentation&mdash;a condition that disproportionately affects people with darker skin tones. Dissatisfied with the existing treatments, Haxton dedicated himself to creating solutions tailored specifically to ethnic skin. His proprietary techniques focus on reducing inflammation, enhancing radiance, and lifting the skin, all while preserving its natural integrity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Among Haxton's most popular treatments are:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Facial Sculpting: Designed to reduce puffiness and enhance facial contours without surgical intervention.</span><br><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Radiance Treatment: Aimed at achieving a brighter, more even complexion, especially for those dealing with uneven skin tone or dullness.</span><br><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Non-Surgical Facelifts: Utilizing advanced techniques to rejuvenate the face, this procedure is ideal for those looking to avoid the risks of keloid scarring associated with traditional facelifts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">The Importance of Specialized Care for Ethnic Skin</span><br><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Ethnic skin types, particularly those of Asian and South Asian heritage, produce more melanin, which serves as a natural defense against UV radiation. However, this same characteristic can make the skin more susceptible to conditions like post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) and keloid formation&mdash;especially when the skin is subjected to stress or invasive procedures. "Understanding how melanin behaves in different skin types is crucial," Haxton explains. "This knowledge allows me to create treatments that not only address the skin's needs but also prevent long-term damage."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">As Kamala Harris continues her campaign, she embodies the essence of what it means to age gracefully while staying true to one's cultural heritage. Her prominence on the global stage highlights the importance of specialized skincare for ethnic skin&mdash;a need that is increasingly recognized and addressed by experts like Haxton.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Looking Forward</span><br><span style="font-size: 18pt;">By 2050, it's projected that nearly 50% of the U.S. population will have skin of color. This demographic shift underscores the importance of skincare professionals like Haxton, who are leading the charge in safe, effective treatments for ethnic skin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">From Hollywood celebrities to Silicon Valley innovators, and now to a potential future president, many are turning to Haxton's organic, non-invasive methods as a preferred alternative to the more aggressive cosmetic procedures of the past. "Everyone's skin tells a story," Haxton says. "My goal is to help my clients, including influential figures like Kamala Harris, tell theirs with confidence and grace."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">For those seeking an alternative to traditional plastic surgery or simply looking to maintain their youthful appearance, Richard Haxton's Transformational Skin Solutions offers a path forward&mdash;one that respects and enhances the natural beauty of ethnic skin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Richard Haxton's Transformational Skin Solutions of Los Altos is conveniently located in Los Altos, California.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Richard&nbsp;Haxton&rsquo;s Facial Sculpting Named Best Beauty Treatment 2024</span><br>&nbsp;<br><br><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Los Altos, California Aug 5, 2024 (Issuewire.com)&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;Richard&nbsp;Haxton&rsquo;s innovative facial sculpting treatment has been honored with the title of Best Beauty Treatment 2024. Renowned for his cutting-edge non-surgical rejuvenation techniques,&nbsp;Haxton&nbsp;is setting new benchmarks in the beauty industry with his exceptional approach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">The Science and Innovation Behind&nbsp;Haxton&rsquo;s Facial Sculpting</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Haxton&rsquo;s facial sculpting treatment is based on scientific principles that focus on the lymphatic system&rsquo;s role in maintaining facial aesthetics. As we age, the lymphatic system becomes less efficient, leading to the buildup of toxins and fluids in facial tissues. This accumulation results in puffiness, dark circles, and an overall tired appearance.&nbsp;Haxton&rsquo;s technique stimulates the lymphatic system, enhancing circulation and facilitating the removal of impurities. This revitalizes the skin, restores natural contours, and imparts a lifted, sculpted, and youthful appearance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Sought-After Expertise in Anti-Aging</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">For over 20 years, Richard Haxton of Richard Haxton's Transformational Skin Solutions (www.SkinByHaxton.com) has been highly sought after by many professionals, ranging from male celebrities to professionals such as police officers, local coaches and members of the tech community.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Shifting Trends in Anti-Aging: Men Taking the Lead</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Over the last two decades, Haxton has seen the progression of men taking an interest in skincare and cosmetic procedures, traditionally an industry marketed to women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The Rise of Men Seeking Anti-Aging Procedures</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In fact, over the last 5 years, there has been a 325% rise in men seeking out cosmetic procedures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Challenging Traditional Notions: Non-Invasive Anti-Aging Solutions</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In the past, plastic surgery and abrasive treatments such as Botox and Fillers have acted as short-lived entries to the fountain of youth, though as Haxton shares, "Most practitioners aren't familiar with the male face. There is a stigma about those types of procedures that men feel may feminize their appearance if done incorrectly."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Pioneering Organic Anti-Aging Treatments</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">As a result, Haxton has pioneered and developed proprietary treatments that are organic, non-invasive, and allow the skin to detoxify &ndash; producing dramatic results that have his clients looking 10 to 20 years younger than their biological age.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Testimonials of Youthfulness</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">"One of my clients recently celebrated his mid-50th birthday and has been coming to me for 20 years&hellip;around the time that society and tech started to hold looking young as a hiring factor. He was delighted to let me know that his 20-year-old co-workers were shocked because they thought he was in his twenties as well."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Silicon Valley's Anti-Aging Challenge: Blue Light Radiation</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Haxton continues, "Silicon Valley is the mecca for one of the most damaging factors in aging &ndash; Blue Light Radiation &ndash; which one can be exposed to by commonly used electronics&hellip;cell phone, PCs, laptops and Flat Screen TVs. These are all devices that most people have utilized extensively during the COVID pandemic."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Innovative Approach: Non-Surgical Rejuvenation Facelift</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In order to counter those effects, Haxton has created the Non-Surgical Rejuvenation Facelift which utilizing leading technology in ultrasound and light waves to facially sculpt one's face naturally&hellip;Haxton is the only one internationally to offer it as a signature service.</span></p>

Today, as it was in the past, men and women of tech have to be Instagram ready. Our appearance is like technology, you're only as relevant as the latest version of yourself."</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Tips for Skin Care During the Winter Months</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">According to acclaimed natural and holistic anti-aging master, Richard Haxton of Richard Haxton's Transformational Skin Solutions of Los Altos (http://www.SkinByHaxton.com), who has a proprietary formula dedicated to non-evasive rejuvenation treatments, "The skin needs extra attention during cold weather because it is the largest organ of the human body." In fact, an article posted circa 2017 by National Geographic stated that adults carry some 8 pounds (3.6 kilograms) and 22 square feet (2 square meters) of skin itself. In addition, Smithsonian Magazine in 2014, wrote that there are 42 facial muscles underlying our facial skin. The winter months can hold the magic and beauty of the season, but also can wreak havoc on our delicate facial skin as our muscles and environmental factors begin to move forward with a cold season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> States Haxton, "During this time of the year, external moisture loss of the skin is accelerated when forced dry heat - like heaters and radiators - pulls moisture out of the air and the skin, making it the time to wear heavier moisturizer to create a barrier against this moisture loss. Additionally, solutions such as running a humidifier or a small indoor fountain will help to put moisture back into air." "Cold weather also slows down the flow of blood to the lymphatic system which nourishes the skin. This decreases the internal moisture level of skin," continues Haxton, "During the winter months, we also tend to drink more hot beverages to stay warm. Many of these beverages contain caffeine. Caffeinated drinks deplete 4 times their weight in water, actually further causing dehydration. Imagine having to drink 4 cups of water to replenish the moisture lost with every 1 cup of caffeinated coffee!" "On a daily basis," shares Haxton, " You should be drinking 64 ounces of spring water, herbal teas or decaffeinated beverages". </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As a final reminder, Haxton states, "Remember that topical creams will not replace moisture in skin; they only serve to lock it in. One reason why night creams are heavier than day creams is that skin loses a lot more moisture at night (cellular repair from the stresses of the day occurs while you are sleeping), and a heavier cream does a better job at preventing moisture from escaping. In addition to drinking plenty of water, taking fish oil supplements can help maintain internal moisture levels of the skin. Check with your doctor before taking any supplements."

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It's no secret that water is the source of life with the human body being up to 80% composed of water - of that the skin itself is 64% water. Without water the skin does not shed it's outer layer and dead cells begin to accumulate which can lead to clogged pores, congestion, puffiness and a lackluster complexion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">SOLUTION: Drink at least 64oz. of water or decaffeinated herbals teas daily - starting the day with two large glasses of water. Additionally, avoid beverages that are high in sugars, caffeine and alcohol content.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As an added bonus, when you are properly hydrated - wrinkles, scars and imperfections appear 30% less.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">High Energy Visible Light (HEV), commonly known as Blue Light, is on the blue end of the light spectrum and has shorter wavelengths and more energy. It is by far the closest to the invisible, ultraviolet (UV) light which is known to burn skin as a sunburn and cause cancer. HEV is emitted from all sorts of devices that many of us use on a daily basis - Flat-Screen TVs, computers, smartphones, tablets and laptops to name a few. This blue light can dramatically lead to changes in your skin cells by cell shrinkage and even cell death - which can lead to an acceleration of the aging process by destroying collagen through oxidative stress and producing more free radicals that damage the skin. It only take a few minutes of exposure to trigger these reactions and increase facial lines and creases by excessive texting, checking emails and viewing media content. Additionally, Blue Light from these devices increases the strain on the eyes and the facial skin around them - the most delicate on the face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">SOLUTION: There are special Blue Light Blocking Screens and Glasses that can be purchased at online sites such as Amazon that are Anti-Blue Light and Anti-UV that will protect both your face and eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">The Importance of Sun Screen</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Ultra Violet Rays are the shortest in the light spectrum. Invisible to the eye, they have the catastrophic ability to burn and damage the skin with sunburns, accelerated aging and even cancer. Sun screens have long been used to combat the sun's rays and while no sunscreen will give you 100% protection against the sun; you can take a look at the SPF to see what will be the best blockage. It's interesting to note that the sun exposure before 14 years of age is the cause of the wrinkles we see when approaching 30 years old.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">SOLUTION: As a standard, an SPF 30 will provide 97% blockage, an SPF 50 (98% blockage) and an SPF 100 (99% blockage). As a rule, suns screens should be applied to the face or body at least 10 minutes before sun exposure or at least 2 minutes before applying makeup.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In an era where stress, anxiety and fear have run rampant across many individuals - society is becoming more conscious of what clinical experts are calling &ldquo;pandemic related aging.&rdquo; The pandemic has affected everything from shifts in pop culture, media and economics to premature aging as people seek remedies to combat the physical changes in their face and bodies while their skincare and beauty professionals are under a &lsquo;stay-at-home&rsquo; situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Highly sought after for over 20 years for his ability to reverse the appearance of aging through non-surgical methods, renowned Master Clinical Esthetician, Richard Haxton of Richard Haxton&rsquo;s Transformational Skin Solutions of Los Altos (http://www.SkinByHaxton.com), provides tips on what individuals can do to fight premature-aging while being indoors.</span></p>
<p><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">What can I do to maintain and rejuvenate my skin while Shelter-in-Place is in effect?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It&rsquo;s incredibly important to stay consistent with both your morning and night time product routines as they produce completely different results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Even though our schedules may have become more lenient as we&rsquo;ve stayed at home - it&rsquo;s still crucial to continue your customized home product system to minimize the aging effects that have occurred because of the lapse of treatments due to Shelter-in-Place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As always, be sure to properly hydrate as our bodies are 70% water and our skin receives the last of any water we drink.</span></p>
<p><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">How is being indoors affecting my skin?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">There are several major issues that will affect your skin in great measure: Stress, Depression and Anxiety. Stress hormones (Cortisol and Adrenaline) stifle oxygen in our bloodstream and deplete our collagen and elasticity in the thinnest external membrane - our facial tissue. Stress also causes our vitamins, nutrients and body moisture to be leached away causing dehydration and depleting more of our body&rsquo;s water absorption. All of these factors lead to sagging, haggard-looking skin that completely dims the vibrancy of our skin&rsquo;s appearance.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">What can I do to prevent premature aging caused by stress and depression?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">On top of regular use of your home treatments, it's important to exercise and self affirm. Nature also can play a role in heightening your mood and your immunity. Depression and anxiety can lead to worn, lackluster skin, increased wrinkles and darkened circles and bags under the eyes; however, when we exercise we release &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; hormones (endorphins). We also create greater circulation to our facial tissue and brain which results in better cognition and the generation of oxygen-rich blood to combat the signs of stress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I recommend a channel on Youtube called &ldquo;Fabulous50s,&rdquo; created by quarantined life coach Schellea Fowler who gives low impact home workouts that are chocked-full of positive affirmations that set you up for a great day and help you to live younger longer.</span></p>
<p><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Should I change my diet?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As always - a good diet should be rich in antioxidants, vitamins and minerals, grains, proteins and dark greens. Foods that are rich in antioxidants include: dark chocolate, pecans, blueberries, strawberries, artichokes, Goji Berries, kale, raspberries, red cabbage, beans (also good for fiber), beets and spinach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It&rsquo;s important also, especially if you&rsquo;re depressed, to stay away from the &ldquo;comfort foods&rdquo; - foods that are high in salts (which causes cells to lose water), carbs (which create high blood sugar levels which excrete from the skin) and sugars (which can lead to breakouts).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It also goes without saying that you should drink plenty of water - I recommend drinking a minimum of 64 oz. a day.</span></p>
<p><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I've been wearing a mask when going outdoors. Why does it look like it's affecting my skin?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">If you&rsquo;ve worn a mask during the pandemic, you may have noticed that lines around the nasal folds have increased or that there also is a level of increased puffiness. This is mostly due to the lymphatic system not draining properly. Masks cover up the lower half of the face which up until COVID-19 hadn't been part of our daily routine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">During the pandemic, I&rsquo;ve fine tuned new methods for this &ldquo;new form of aging.&rdquo; that specifically address this issue. Additionally, if you&rsquo;ve noticed break-outs while wearing the paper masks, it may be due to an allergy to the paper fibers used to create them. I recommend using a cloth or fabric mask to stay protected and spare your skin. To avoid skin issues make sure to clean or change your mask regularly.</span></p>
<p><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Is my skin affected by how much additional time I'm spending in front of electronic devices during Shelter-in-Place?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Yes. Science has shown that Blue Light Emissions do radiate from the electronics we are now concentrating on in order to stay in touch. Not only do these electronic devices (smartphones, laptops/PCs/tablets and television) disrupt your sleep cycle, they stimulate the production of free radicals in the skin, accelerating the appearance of aging and contributing to photo-aging, wrinkles, worsening skin laxity and hyper-pigmentation. I recommend a blue light filter screen that can be found online for purchase to minimize the effects.</span></p>

<p style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; white-space: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Strawberries are high in antioxidants, including vitamin C which plays an integral role in the formation of collagen. They help combat premature aging, wrinkles, and even protect against broken capillaries under the skin&rsquo;s surface. Did you know that strawberries can also whiten teeth? By mashing and applying strawberries directly onto teeth, you have a natural alternative to today&rsquo;s teeth-whitening kits that contain chemicals like peroxide and titanium dioxide. So, the next time you are posing for the camera, &ldquo;Say Strawberr-eez!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Los Altos, Feb 18, 2020 (Issuewire.com) - Aside from their own personal celebrity brands - Jennifer Lopez, Chrissy Teegan, Mario Lopez, John Legend and Kim Kardashian all have the following in common...each one has an ethnic skin type that embraces the art of aging gracefully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It&rsquo;s 2020 and America has never been more diverse in ethnicity, taking into consideration that in 2015, 38% of the US population identified itself as white as opposed to the 87% that identified as Caucasian in 1970 according to the US Census.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">While America continues to mature with its ever-growing multi-ethnic population, there also has been a rise in facial cosmetic procedures to maintain the same youthful appearance as Hollywood&rsquo;s most glamorous over 40. According to natural-aging specialists and experts in the rejuvenation of ethnic skin types, Richard Haxton of Richard Haxton's Transformational Skin Solutions of Los Altos (http://www.SkinByHaxton.com), &ldquo;The need for broader education and addressing the needs of ethnic skin types has been a major need for years.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Haxton, who pioneered some of the major developments in skincare came into the field while exploring options that could help him with his own problematic skin. Being prone to hyperpigmentation, Haxton&rsquo;s skin type fell into the same category as most ethnic skin types and realizing early on that the standards for the study were lacking on the skin of color - Haxton created various treatments and new techniques to address the needs of people of ethnic tones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&ldquo;What's considered traditional procedures (laser resurfacing, plastic surgery and injectables) are just not options for an individual with an ethnic skin type,&rdquo; continues Haxton, &ldquo;It can lead to the exact opposite of the desired result due to the sensitivity of the skin being more prone to scarring."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The reason may be deceivingly simple - each skin type has its own distinct characteristics and when it comes to ethnic skin types, there is more to consider than just melanin - the pigmentation quality that provides each of us with our own personal hue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In the skin of color, especially in Latinx, Asian, East Indian and Black skin of African descent melanin is produced consistently and acts as one of the main protections against UV radiation.</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The cells in the human epidermis that produce and distribute melanin, melanocytes, have long been studied in the field of skincare and beauty. In fact, it&rsquo;s not how many melanocytes a person has (we all have about the same amount), it&rsquo;s how active they are within the body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As Haxton explains this can determine whether one can have hyperpigmentation (producing too much pigmentation) or hypopigmentation (producing too little pigmentation)...two of the major skin conditions that exist in ethnic skin types. When the skin of color is under stress it can also be prone to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), leading to increased melanin and scars/spots that can take years to fade if being treated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Additionally, ethnic skin types have a much greater tendency to develop what is known as "keloid scarring" which occurs when scar tissue continues to build upon itself creating massive welt-like or mountainous growths. As Haxton states, &ldquo;Regrettably, this can occur with cosmetic procedures [with facial procedures at the top of the list] as simple as getting a tattoo or having one&rsquo;s ears pierced. These situations can have life-long damages not only to one's skin but also to one's confidence - one's essence.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">According to the Skin of Color Society, by 2050 nearly 50% of the United States population will have a skin of color which may be one of the major reasons The University of California San Francisco opened a &ldquo;skin of color&rdquo; dermatology clinic late 2018 to address the disparity of care for ethic skin types.</span><br> <br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Being one of the few in the world that specialize in holistic techniques for ethnic skin types, Haxton is all too familiar with the shortage of experts, leading him to create proprietary and unique methods that are customized to ethnic skin. In fact, celebrities and tech professionals have sought out his organic treatments, developed over 20 years, to rejuvenate their skin</span>. <br> <br>&ldquo;Facial Sculpting [to reduce puffiness in the face], Radiance [to establish brightness in the skin] and Non-Surgical Facelifts [to rejuvenate the facial appearance] are treatments I designed specifically to prevent keloid scarring with my clients,&rdquo; shares Haxton, &ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s skin tells a story about their lifestyle - it&rsquo;s my calling to provide professional advice and personal treatment plans so my clients can feel they can put their best face forward.&rdquo; <br> <br>Richard Haxton&rsquo;s Transformational Skin Solutions of Los Altos is located in the foothills of Los Altos, California.</p>

<p style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; white-space: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br>(The Magazine Plus Editorial):- San Francisco, Jan 24, 2020 (Issuewire.com) &ndash; On January 25, 2020, over 1.5 billion people around the world will gather to celebrate the Lunar New Year &ndash; the year of the Yang White Metal Rat, the first of the lucky animal signs of the Chinese zodiac, and with it will come a flurry of food, festivities, and photographs. <br>According to Chinese astrology, the fixed elemental symbol of the Rat is water which makes this year a particularly important one to put one&rsquo;s best face forward in beauty, cleansing, balance, new beginnings, and renewals. <br></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; white-space: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The addition of Metal (the counterpart of Water) also has 2020 focused on certain industries that should thrive, including technology, according to www.TheChineseZodiac.org. In Silicon Valley, where social and search monoliths such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and Google reside, the fusion of tech, beauty and balance couldn&rsquo;t be more poignant for the Lunar New Year.<br></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; white-space: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">On average, almost 95 million photos are uploaded to Instagram every day, just a third of the staggering 350 million photos uploaded to Facebook daily according to a white paper released by the social media giant and published by Business Insider. In fact, in an article published on Inc.com, Google reports that its Android devices take 93 million selfies a day. Considering the number of photos that are traditionally taken around any major holiday (consciously or unconsciously), it&rsquo;s no wonder why beauty and balance are at the forefront of the White Metal Rat Lunar New Year.<br>&ldquo;In this time, it&rsquo;s important to keep a balance both externally and internally &ndash; in order to create the renewal we need to remove all our toxins,&rdquo; shares renowned anti-aging master and specialist in holistic non-surgical procedures Richard Haxton of Richard Haxton&rsquo;s Transformational Skin Solutions of Los Altos (www.SkinByHaxton.com). <br> </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; white-space: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&ldquo;Modern living comes with consequences &ndash; toxic exposure to blue light in electronic devices, carbon emissions and poor diet all put our bodies in a place to prematurely age which can take away our self-confidence, and with it, the fortune that should come with the New Year.&rdquo; <br></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; white-space: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This is one of the major reasons Haxton decided to create a method twenty years ago to give individuals an alternative option to plastic surgery and invasive techniques to restore the organic beauty of their youth &ndash; his proprietary facial sculpting and the Haxton non-surgical facelift. <br></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; white-space: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As Haxton continues, &ldquo;The Year of the Metal Rat, combined with Western ideas of 2020, calls for personal harmony. In Eastern philosophy, people born in the year of the Metal Rat tend to be intelligent, observant and popular &ndash; loving to attend parties and social gatherings &ndash; and at all times keeping conversation to a high point&hellip;which is important to note because it shows that the main and primary focal point is the beauty and balance of the face.&rdquo;<br>In fact, Psychology Today author Benedict Jones, Ph.D. &ndash; professor at the Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology (University of Glasgow) has written on how the first impressions we form about other people based on their facial appearance can influence important social outcomes and usually are formed within 100 milliseconds. These impressions include traits of valence, trustworthiness, dominance, and competence &ndash; which makes finding the most natural means to create balance in the face all the more important.<br></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; white-space: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&ldquo;We live in the most visually critical time with the impact of social media,&rdquo; states Haxton, &ldquo;There are literally millions of photos out there that act as a reflection of your life. My wish for the Lunar New Year is that they not only reflect the beauty and balance of the face &ndash; but also the heart.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Celebrities often spend THOUSANDS of dollars on collagen masks to firm their facial skin and shrink pores. You can give yourself a similar Hollywood Facelift for just a few cents and the ingredients are probably available in your kitchen right now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The following simple, homemade mask just using one fresh, cold egg white and one teaspoon of cornstarch can provide the same dramatic, skin-firming results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Combine the egg white and cornstarch in a small bowl until foamy and well-blended. The mask should be smooth and gel-like.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Using your fingers, spread a thin, even layer over the face and throat and lie down for at least 20 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Note: When this mask dries completely, it will feel very tight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">If you can, lie down on a slanted surface that tilts your head back; this way gravity will not accentuate any wrinkles in your face while the mask dries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Rinse with cold water and enjoy the amazing results for about 8 hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This is the perfect preparation for a holiday event or a post-party pick-up!</span><br><br><br><br><br></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">The Best of the Bay Area: Master of Anti-Aging, Richard Haxton, Has Changed the Face of Aging</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Nov. 6, 2019 / PRZen / SAN FRANCISCO -- In a valley where iconic powerhouses such as Apple, Facebook and Google are changing life as we know it through technology, another dynamic leader of one of the world's fastest growing industries - anti-aging products and services, is changing the face of aging and bringing it to a halt. Acclaimed as one of the world's top anti-aging specialists in natural skin rejuvenation, Richard Haxton of Richard Haxton's Transformational Skin Solutions of Los Altos (http://www.SkinByHaxton.com) is known to reverse the appearance of age up to 10 to 20 years without the use of cosmetic surgery. Today, aging baby boomers searching for the fountain of youth realize that investing in "skin enhancers" can be an asset or a detriment to their second half of life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Whether looking for a new job or new date, the first impression can be the last - especially for men and women over the age of 30; that's when visible signs of aging start to suddenly appear more rapidly and anti-aging management becomes a necessary investment to stay relevant and marketable. In the Western world, when you begin to age, you're not as marketable which commonly leads to a state of depression. Fortunately, today there is a way to slow down the aging process without cosmetic surgery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Haxton's ability for non-surgical face lift rejuvenation offers a more affordable, natural and non-invasive alternative to harsh procedures such as plastic surgery, lasers or injectables.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Alternative holistic treatments have been used by Jennifer Lopez, Tom Cruise and Sandra Bullock to name a few of the many celebrities that never seem to age and Haxton has perfected the method with his revolutionary and proprietary natural skin care treatments that makes people of all ethnic skin types look decades younger than their biological age without cosmetic surgery or Botox injections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">According to Haxton, people are experiencing accelerated aging due to today's modern day living, causing the lymphatic and respiratory systems to be severely compromised. After many years of visiting practitioners and searching for a skin care solution for his own problematic skin, acute acne, scarring and discoloration disorder with no success, he made a breakthrough with the lymphatic system and rejuvenating the skin. Haxton discovered a more natural approach to anti-aging without cosmetic surgery to restore a youthful healthy appearance to the face; in addition he pinpointed other lifestyle factors that affect our biology and the aging process, including the following:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Depletion of the ozone;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Exposure to environmental toxins, including exposure to ultraviolet sun rays and modern technology;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Extreme amounts of stress and anxiety at home and work;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Severe dehydration from inadequate water consumption;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Poor nutrition, including extreme consumption of caffeinated beverages, frozen dinners with pesticides and fast food;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Poor monitoring standards and requirements by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA);</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Less exercise due to sedentary behavior</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Among Haxton's clients are celebrities, influencers and technology leaders traveling from all parts of the globe, up and rising young professionals and well to do retirees who want to keep their profile pictures current for career advancement, re-entry into the job market or finding the perfect mate to share their success. Fortunately, if you live in the Bay Area, you don't have to travel to Beverly Hills to get the same anti-aging treatments only available previously to those in the industry - Richard Haxton's Transformational Skin Solutions of Los Altos is situated just along the foot of the Los Altos Hills in California. Under his expertise, some of the most famous technology icons of Silicon Valley are clandestinely taking advantage of his services, walking the red carpets of the most prestigious events with a new face that looks youthful and impressive.</span></p>

<p style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; white-space: normal;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Illuminate the Season with Beautiful Skin</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">If your goal is to have better skin for this holiday season and put your best face forward for the new year, there are a few things you should know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Having great skin requires a great deal more than taking advantage of the latest treatments. Great skin and great health are achieved through the right combination of diet and exercise. Glowing skin is said to be a sign of a good diet, while dry, pale or oily skin may be the result of poor intake of adequate nutrients. Skin is an outer reflection of your inner health. Every nutrient plays a role in keeping skin healthy, and the list of nutrients that benefit the skin is almost infinite.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The importance of water is essential to beautiful skin (64 ounces minimum a day), following a diet high in antioxidants such as vitamins C and E to improve your skin and your immune system at the same time. Antioxidants fight free radical damage, and protect your skin from aging and pollution. A good multi-vitamin will have a baseline amount of antioxidants. You can also get antioxidants through your diet by adding a generous dose of natural phytochemicals found in greens such as alfalfa, barley, broccoli, Brussel sprouts, cauliflower, cabbage and wheat grass.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">According to anti-aging specialist, Richard Haxton of Richard Haxton's Transformational Skin Solutions of Los Altos, after the age of twenty-three very little nutrition from supplements and diet gets to your skin as it is the last organ to benefit. Therefore, it is important to use credible topical cosmeceuticals containing at least 20% vitamin C and other key antioxidants such as alpha-lipoic acid, DMAE, coenzyme Q10 and grape seed extract each day to rejuvenate and firm skin, reduce the appearance of wrinkles, and keep your skin looking youthful. So this holiday season, may the first glow in the room start with your complexion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Great Memory And Beautiful Skin &mdash; What Do They Have In Common?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">SAN FRANCISCO - May 18, 2019 - PRLog -- If you follow the advice of any health care practitioner on improving your memory, he or she will ultimately say the same thing that international experts such as Richard Haxton of Richard Haxton's Transformational Skin Solutions of Los Altos (http://www.SkinByHaxton.com) have been saying for years - Beauty Comes From Within.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The brain is the body's largest user of oxygen, so regular exercise is essential for improving memory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In fact, according to Harvard Health Publishing, "Certain food are particularly rich in healthful components like omega-3 fatty acids, B vitamins, and antioxidants, which are known to support brain health and often referred to as brain foods. Incorporating many of these foods into a healthy diet on a regular basis can improve the health of your brain, which could translate into better mental function."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As Haxton states "A diet that is rich in vitamins and antioxidants will not only help keep you healthy, but also will keep cortisol, a major stress hormone, under control. It's a known truth that stress is a major contributor to memory problems and can have catastrophic effects on one's skin - from fatigued features to sallow and baggy eyes. In other words, our lifestyle as a whole affects not only our skin, but also our memory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Haxton, who has created a revolutionary holistic and proprietary non-surgical treatment for facial rejuvenation, takes dietary factors into account at his clinic with his clients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"What we put into our systems, ultimately will surface on the outside - so it's a good reminder to be conscious of our diets so we can maintain a youthful appearance. Now that is truly something to</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">keep in mind!"</span></p>

Did you know your skin will also look more luminous, and the appearance of fine lines and scars can be reduced in appearance by as much as 30% if you make water your first step in your cosmetic regime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">According to leading anti-aging expert Richard Haxton of Richard Haxton's Transformational Skin Solutions of Los Altos (http://www.skinbyhaxton.com), "The largest organ of your body happens to be your skin so keeping those cells hydrated can keep you looking and feeling younger."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Benefits that have been cited include:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&bull; Improved Complexion</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&bull; Reduced Puffiness</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&bull; Faster Healing</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&bull; Clearing Acne</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&bull; Slowing the Aging Process</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&bull; A reduction in pore size</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&bull; Weight Loss</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&bull; Promotes the burning of more calories during workouts</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&bull; An increase in better vision</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&bull; Keeps belly bloat in check and suppresses appetite</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 24pt;">Why Mother Knows Best According to Science</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">SAN FRANCISCO - May 12, 2019 - Californer -- It's Mother's Day and that means that new moms and wiser ones are being honored internationally for providing that sacred gift of life...and it's no doubt that mother's intuitions may make them the smartest individuals on the planet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">According to renowned Anti-aging Specialist and Wellness Practitioner, Richard Haxton of Richard Haxton's Tranformational Skin Solutions of Los Altos (http://www.skinbyhaxton.com), "There is a phenomena that I've observed in my family members and clients that are mothers of all ages that would validate the incredible nature of women to function under extreme circumstances - including lack of sleep. In fact, mothers do become more biologically intelligent for the well-being of their offspring."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Science has now established that there is a connection with mothers' innate "6th sense" having to do with being able to achieve "Baby Brain" during pregnancy; where the brain's gray matter, the pinkish-gray tissue containing the cell bodies and synapses of nerve cells actually shrinks. According to current studies, researchers have used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine that pregnancy shrinks the areas of the brain that are involved in social cognition, as well as, the ability to figure out what someone else is thinking and feeling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As Haxton's states, "There is so much that I've learned from my own mother that I impart to clients such as the importance of a balanced diet that incorporates natural vitamins, minerals and proteins with healthy carbohydrates. She taught me to stay hydrated, get sleep/rest and to stay focused with high moral and work ethics. What I received as a gift from her, I've tried to give back in my professional and personal life - that's the biggest honor I can give back to her this Mother's Day."</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">The Secret To Shine Like A Star On Your Wedding Day</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">SAN FRANCISCO - May 6, 2019 - Californer -- </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">For any couple that's planning to marry, the investment of looking your best for those lifetime memories on that special day is often a top priority. In fact, most couples will spend almost a year to plan out the event to perfection. When it comes to wedding days, depending on the culture, the ceremonies can last for days. Some traditional Indian weddings, for example can last at least a total of 3 days, up until a week. Traditional Russian weddings can last up to 2 days and in China, Chinese couples will often go to photo studios to take "glamour </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">shots," posing in multiple gowns and various backgrounds.<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In all of these instances &ndash; the most important outfit one can wear is their face to avoid having a retouched look, which is why brides and grooms have long traveled to renowned anti-aging and non-surgical and holistic facial rejuvenation expert Richard Haxton of Richard Haxton's Transformational Skin Solutions of Los Altos (http://www.SkinByHaxton.com)<br>Recognized internationally as one of the best anti-aging specialist, Haxton discovered the hidden secret of the lymphatic system and how it affected the face, eventually developing his proprietary technique for Non surgical face-lift treatments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">These non-evasive treatments are a miracle remedy to those ready walk down the aisle by reducing the appearance of puffiness, wrinkles, under-eye dark circles and by eliminating the gray appearance that comes with stress and aging. As Haxton notes, after the age of 23 the face begins to hold onto toxins and over time this buildup can be seen as sagging skin, wrinkles, crow's feet, bags, enlarged pores and a general lackluster appearance. It is the last thing anyone would want for those coveted photos whether you be the bride, groom or an attendee. As many a wedding planner would concur, photos are forever, especial in this digital age.<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Having worked with many celebrities, the highly skilled Haxton knows how to give brides and grooms that luminous look that fairy tale couples like Priyanka Chopra & Nick Jonas and Jennifer Lopez & Alex Rodriguez are known for. With his proprietary methods, including Haxton's non-surgical face-lift, Richard Haxton is able to offer and deliver a Hollywood treatment that leaves the skin looking more healthy, vibrant, youthful and natural.<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">When combining holistic rejuvenation methods with an exclusive form of endermology, more commonly known as 'facial sculpting,' the face becomes like a primed smooth canvas for photos. For men and women who prefer the more natural look, this non-evasive technique could not be a better solution for a well rested and radiant appearance.<br>Client testimonials have reported looking 10 year younger than their biological age with Haxton's Signature treatments.<br>It's good to know that from the first session, one will witness a tremendous difference in skin texture and appearance that will make your wedding day in the spotlight seem like a gift from heaven.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br>"It is a joy when couples report how pleased they are with their appearance in their wedding photos," states Haxton, "It's good to play a contributing role in the creation of memories that will always be a part of your treasured wedding collection."</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">PARTY PROOF YOUR SKIN FOR CINCO DE MAYO</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">DRINK WATER to restore your hydration</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Alcohol is notoriously dehydrating. The fact that bar-snacks are always super-salty adds to the problem. One way to prevent your skin from shriveling to a post-party crisp is to drink water while you&rsquo;re slamming down those south-of-the-border cocktails. Ideally, pace yourself one-to-one&mdash;one glass of water for every stronger beverage-- as the night goes on. Doing this also helps prevent the cottonmouth and skull-pounding headache that linger long after the mariachishave warbled Buenas Noches. After the fact, sip water throughout the next day as the alcohol leaves your system. Sports- or energy-drinks containing electrolytes replace lost minerals, but skip brands that contain caffeine. Skip coffee for the same reason, since caffeine is a diuretic that will force more fluids from the body.</span><br> <br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">CALM INFLAMMATION with cleansing and cold</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The dawning of May 6 may find your skin feeling hot and puffy, and maybe even looking a bit red because your capillaries are working double-time to flush out those high-test toxins from last night&rsquo;s cantina-crawl. Alcohol kicks up an inflammatory reaction, slowing down the ability of cells to release the waste-products that have collected in your tissues, so you feel and look sluggish.</span></p>
<p><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In Mexico, the traditional hangover cure is a nice, big, steaming bowl of menudo (tripe stew) at daybreak. Hmmm, not so much? To put your skin back on the road to recovery, start by washing your face. Sleeping in your makeup is always a no-no, and Cinco de Mayo is no exception.</span></p>
<p><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Try a foaming liquid cleanser that de-toxes with antioxidant Green Tea Oil, and also gently exfoliates with a botanical Alpha Hydroxy Acid (AHA) like Apple Fruit Extract. Whisking away shed cells, sweat and grime from the surface of your skin will allow those plugged pores to release their cache of built-up toxins, helping skin recover from the Cinco-assault. Cleansing and exfoliating can also help prevent blemishes from popping up a day or two later.</span></p>
<p><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">After cleansing, ice down your face to de-puff your eyes. Newsflash from the frozen food aisle: a big bag of frozen peas works wonders as an emergency ice-pack, since the bag becomes flexible after a few minutes as the peas begin to thaw.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">COMPENSATE FOR LOST SLEEP with a sheet-mask</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Happy Hour Trivia: the word &ldquo;groggy&rdquo; comes from &ldquo;grog&rdquo;, the watered-down rum rations of the British Royal Navy.</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Alcohol is a trickster. Throwing back a few strong ones may make you sleepy enough to hit the futon pronto, but when you&rsquo;re catching some Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Zs under the influence, your Rapid Eye Movement (REM) activity will be upset. So, your quality of sleep will be poor. You may wake frequently, and still feel groggy even after several hours in bed.</span></p>
<p><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Since there is no magic substitute for real sleep, chill out under a sheet mask.Look for masks containing skin-plumping Hyaluronic Acid, and energizing stem-cell extracts from Peach Blossom, Moon Orchid, and Ice Plant. Pair with a disco-nap (15-20 minutes)! Then peel off the mask, gently pat any remaining serum into your skin, and return to the land of the living feeling almost-human.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">RE-ENERGIZE with peptides and botanicals</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Boozing, especially when combined with the cigarette smoke that billows through lots of happening bars and nightspots, not to mention salty, processed food, triggers massive oxidative stress in the body. This oxidation leads to cellular damage that we experience as the aging process. If you look in the mirror the morning after a hard night, then it&rsquo;s time to bust out the skin treatments containing peptides and mild botanical astringents like White Oak Bark, to instantly tighten up pores and uplift partied-out skin. Targeted treatment products perform like &ldquo;shapewear&rdquo; for the skin, boosting and firming up even tired eyes. When choosing a treatment product, also pick ingredients that are high in antioxidants, like Acai Fruit Extract, to fight the free radicals that stream onto your skin at your local watering-hole and in the world at large. The result: rested, hydrated complexion that lights up the cantina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Cheers to that!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">The Beauty of Fish Oil</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">With fishing season just around the corner and opening day for trout fishing this weekend (AKA "Fishmas") - it would only make sense to share with you the benefits of these incredible animals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It&rsquo;s no secret that supplementing with fish oil has many benefits. I&rsquo;ve been recommending it to my clients since cold liver oil was all that was available! Today you can find fish oil supplements that have been processed to minimize the fishy flavor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Research indicates fish oil has a valuable role in the prevention of cardiovascular disease &mdash; lowering triglycerides, slowing the development of plaque in arterial walls and reducing blood pressure. What you may not know is that fish oil can help prevent wrinkles and delay the aging process associated with decreased collagen production.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Fish oil contains Omega 3 essential fatty acids which regulate cellular function and help promote healthy skin. By increasing the flow of blood in your skin, enzymes are stimulated to produce structural proteins needed for the formation and maintenance of collagen and elastin, proteins that are necessary for maintaining skin tone, suppleness and elasticity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Omega 3 fish oil contains two active ingredients: EPA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid) and DHA (Docosahexaenoic Acid). Both are vital nutrients, but each has important roles at different stages of life. EPA specifically has benefits for the skin:</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">EPA can help limit the damage to the skin due to sun exposure and help to reduce the negative effect of UV rays.</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">EPA inhibits the production of androgens, hormones that affect the production of sebum in the hair follicle. Acne and other skin problems can be attributed to excess sebum production.</span><br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">EPA helps to limit production of Arachidonic Acid, which is responsible for inflammatory responses in the body.</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In other words, supplementing with fish oil that contains EPA can not only help maintain beautiful skin, but also alleviate the symptoms of skin disorders such as dry and flaky skin, psoriasis, eczema and acne as well as many other inflammatory skin conditions.</span></p>

<p style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; white-space: normal;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">It's Springtime and Easter...If you love chocolate... here's how you'll love it more!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dark chocolate is full of antioxidants that are beneficial to your brain and your heart. Nature's darkest delicacy, is also found in cocoa and the levels of resveratrol; a polyphenolic compound often associated with the health benefits, found in dark chocolate is second only to red wine among known sources of resveratrol.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dark chocolate is also known to create an intense buzz comparable to the thrill of an ardent kiss. Researchers have found that the dark chocolate not only causes a more intense and longer lasting emotional high than kissing, but also doubled volunteers&rsquo; heart rates! This may be due in part to phenylethylamine, a natural stimulant found in chocolate that is believed to trigger feelings similar to those felt when falling in love.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">So this Spring Fling Season, enjoy that dark chocolate for dessert while romancing your sweetheart and the rebirth of love. You&rsquo;ll be improving your cardiovascular health, enhancing blood flow, and reducing blood pressure at the same time.</span></p>

<p style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; white-space: normal;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Why the demand to look young in Silicon Valley is becoming essentially greater than Hollywood</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Los Altos, Apr 8, 2019 (Issuewire.com) - In Silicon Valley, techies and budding million-dollar entrepreneurs have run into a crisis: How do I stay relevant and how do I remain youthful?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">No longer is it Hollywood&rsquo;s A-list elite that is vying to look new day fresh; in the tech capital of the world, if you don&rsquo;t look the part &ndash; you don&rsquo;t get the job.</span></p>
<p><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no photoshopping yourself for a Skype interview,&rdquo; says renowned natural anti-aging specialist Richard Haxton of Richard Haxton&rsquo;s Transformational Skin Solutions of Los Altos (SkinByHaxton.com).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">With the growing epidemic of ageism at mega-corps such as Google, Facebook and Apple, there has been a stampede to find a solution to look young to survive in today&rsquo;s job market. In San Francisco, the cost of living alone is 14.72% higher than Google&rsquo;s future home of San Jose (Source: Numbeo), with a single individual shelling out almost $3600 just for rent. Such a high cost of living has made job security a major priority, striking everyone from entry-level to top executives. In fact, the median age at major tech companies ranges between 27 and 39 years of age creating a massive need to appear more youthful; not only for self-confidence but for the livelihood of one&rsquo;s career.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The irony is because of technology, we are aging faster, due mostly to the ever-increasing radiation and stress caused by the UV and blue-light emissions from the artificial lighting of digital screens (i.e. smartphones, laptops, tablets, computers and TVs)</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">According to Haxton and a study published in Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity, exposure to blue light stimulates the production of free radicals in the skin, which accelerates the appearance of facial aging, photo-ageing, wrinkles, hyper-pigmentation and a loss of elasticity of the skin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">With the average American spending over 11 hours in front of a screen, according to a recent Nielsen&rsquo;s Company report, it&rsquo;s no wonder why 40, 30 and even 20-something year-olds are pursuing Haxton, who is also recognized as the Best of the Bay Area in his field.</span></p>
<p><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&ldquo;Organic rejuvenation is the most effective means of reversing the aging process without evasive surgical methods. My clients in technology come to me seeking a natural method away from the Botox and Fillers, also known as the &lsquo;fashion look,&rsquo; so that they can achieve career longevity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As Haxton notes, &ldquo;People can spend well into the thousands for units of Botox and Fillers that have a shelf life of just a few months. Thanks to the natural anti-aging process practised at my clinic, clients don&rsquo;t have to be exposed to painful needles and can achieve a youthful appearance that lasts several times longer - creating true rejuvenation"</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Having pioneered a propriwww.skinbyhaxton.cometary method of facial sculpting - a method that includes manipulation of the lymphatic system to &ldquo;retain firmness&rdquo; of the skin, Haxton has been internationally recognized for self-developing the signature &lsquo;Haxton&rsquo;s Non-Surgical Face-Lift&rsquo;, which also incorporates a unique form of holistic facial rejuvenation.</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Within the Hollywood scene, celebrities such as Jennifer Lopez, Kim Kardashian and Scarlett Johannson have spoken about the importance of alternative holistic treatments that they have benefited from; and now it appears that the movement has transcended to the new capital of youth for both men and women &ndash; Silicon Valley.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&ldquo;The way that we are aging is ever-changing, just like technology,&rdquo; says Haxton, who is constantly innovating new treatments that keep him and his clients looking years younger than their biological age. &ldquo;The good news is, it&rsquo;s never too early or too late to look healthier and younger.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">While the beauties and brawn of Hollywood may be used to ushering in a sigh of relief once the cameras are off and the pressure to look red-carpet worthy has tapered; Silicon Valley will still be under the daily pressure and scrutiny to look young.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">April&rsquo;s Quick Tip: Rejuvenate Skin with an Egg, a Classic Symbol of Spring</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">While oily skin benefits from egg whites, dry skin benefits from egg yolk.</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">To recover from the dry Winter months, add the following to your Spring ritual to balance your skin:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Create a moisturizing mask of one egg yolk mixed with two tablespoons of milk and half a teaspoon of honey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Gently spread mask on face, keeping a damp towel nearby to dry off your hands afterward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Leave on face for 15 minutes, then rinse with lukewarm water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Your skin should feel dewy soft; seal in this moisturizing treatment with a nourishing facial cream.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: justify;"></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Eggs are not just a symbol of Spring and Easter they are one of nature&rsquo;s most beneficial and nutritionally complete foods and especially in today&rsquo;s economy, everyone should know that eggs are a good source of low-cost high-quality protein, providing 5.5 grams of protein in one egg for a caloric cost of only 68 calories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Not only do eggs have a high protein content, but 93.7% of that protein is actually usable by the body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Eggs contain all essential amino acids for humans and supply numerous vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin A, vitamin E, several B vitamins including niacin (B3) and thiamine (B1), folate, phosphorous and iron, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, zinc, copper, manganese and selenium. I don&rsquo;t think I need to remind you that healthy skin depends on a daily supply of these vitamins and minerals!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Additionally, the presence of choline and lecithin has both been shown by research to be beneficial for our nervous system in increasing memory and delaying Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. Eggs are an exceptional source of lutein and xeaxanthin, as well as anti-inflammatory omega-3 essential fatty acids. These carotenoids appear to be especially well absorbed into the retina, which may reduce the risk of developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">So go ahead, start your day with a roasted egg and turn those Easter Eggs into egg salad sandwiches after the hunt is over.</span></p>
<p><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">You&rsquo;ll be nourishing your body with a valuable food source in celebration of Spring.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: justify;"></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: justify;"></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Since kale became a staple in our morning smoothies and favorite salads, it didn&rsquo;t take long for us to notice that the vegetable reaped benefits for our health and our skin. Infused with antioxidants and iron, among numerous other nutrients, the leafy green reduces inflammation, treats sun damage, and promotes elasticity in the hair. No surprise here&mdash;kale is now making its way to the beauty aisle with topical treatments that reap similar benefits and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">SKIN</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Kale is loaded with Vitamins A, C and K, lutein, iron, and antioxidants. The vitamin K in kale helps to reduce the dark circles under your eyes and &lsquo;tightens&rsquo; your skin, thereby reducing fine lines and wrinkles. It also helps to reduce the swelling and scars that may form after medical procedures. Lutein, a carotenoid, also promotes collagen production, which is essential for your skin&rsquo;s strength and &lsquo;full&rsquo; appearance. Both vitamin A and antioxidants repair skin tissue while also preventing free-radical damage. Kale beauty products are also known to be beneficial for detoxification. These products help to keep your skin hydrated while cleaning out your pores and providing your skin with a healthier look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">HAIR</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Kale has both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which keep the hair and scalp moisturized. The fatty acids also reduce dandruff and alleviate a flaky scalp and may even speed up hair growth. Blend together four washed kale leaves, a lemon, and a teaspoon of olive oil into a thick paste. Massage into the scalp, let it sit for 20 minutes, and then rinse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">NAILS</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Since hair and nails are both made out of keratin, it&rsquo;s no wonder that the veggie has made its merry way to the nail too. Boasting high levels of vitamins A, C and K, kale stimulates keratin production and results in longer, stronger, and better-hydrated nails.</span></p>
